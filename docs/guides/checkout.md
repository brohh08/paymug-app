# Checkout

The buyer opens a product link, applies a discount if available, pays through the
selected provider, and returns to Paymug.

When a product sells extra seats, the buyer picks the number of extra seats on
the product page. The seats are added to the order total and to the license seat
limit. Checkout links can preselect them with `?[custom][extra_seats]=3`; the
server recalculates the price from the product's current seat tiers.

A browser success page is not proof of payment. The provider callback must confirm
the payment before Paymug marks the order paid and gives access to delivery.

If payment succeeded but delivery is missing, check the order status, provider
mode, webhook setup, customer email, and product delivery settings.
