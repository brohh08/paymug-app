# Public API reference

Base URL: the Paymug installation URL.  
Content type: `application/json` for JSON requests.  
Authentication: API key in `Authorization: Bearer <key>` or `x-api-key`.

## Supported resource endpoints

| Method | Path | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/products` | Products for the API-key owner |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/orders` | Orders for the API-key owner |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/customers` | Customers for the API-key owner |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/licenses/activate` | Activate a Pro installation |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/licenses/validate` | Validate a Pro installation |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/licenses/deactivate` | Deactivate a Pro installation |

The resource list responses are JSON objects with a plural top-level field such
as `products`, `orders`, or `customers`. Treat item fields as contract data only
when the current API reference documents them.

## License seat availability

`POST /api/v1/licenses/activate` and `POST /api/v1/licenses/validate` return
`seatLimit` (integer or `null` for unlimited), `seatsUsed`, and `seatsRemaining`
(integer or `null`) alongside `valid`, `state`, and `features`. Validate a new
`instanceId` to read free seats without activating; see the
[license runbook](/docs/license-activation.md).

## Product extra seats

Items in `GET /api/v1/products` include these fields for licensed products:

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `licenseSeatLimit` | integer or `null` | Base device seats; `null` is unlimited |
| `extraSeatsEnabled` | boolean | Buyers can purchase seats beyond the base limit |
| `extraSeatLabel` | string | Buyer-facing name for extra seats; empty means the default "Extra seats" |
| `extraSeatTiers` | array | Per-seat prices in cents: `[{ "from": 1, "price": 500 }, { "from": 11, "price": 300 }]` |

Tiers accumulate: each extra seat is charged at the price of the tier it falls
in, and the first tier always starts at `from: 1`. Extra seats require a finite
`licenseSeatLimit`. A buyer selects them with the checkout custom field
`extra_seats` (for example `?[custom][extra_seats]=3` on the product link, or
`custom: { "extra_seats": "3" }` in checkout requests). The server calculates the
price; ignore any client-side total.

## Authentication example

```bash
curl "$BASE_URL/api/v1/products" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PAYMUG_API_KEY"
```

`401` means the key is missing, invalid, or expired. Do not create a second key
until you have checked the header, base URL, and key value.
